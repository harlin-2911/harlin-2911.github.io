    <h1>How to see the moon turn red during March’s total lunar eclipse</h1>

    <p>The eclipse will be visible in western African and western Europe, the Americas, eastern Australia, New Zealand, northern Japan and eastern Russia Thursday evening and Friday morning, depending on where you live, according to EarthSky. Check Time and Date’s website to see exactly when the eclipse will be visible over your area, weather permitting.</p>

    <p>A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth is between the sun and moon and the three celestial objects line up in a nearly perfect row, with Earth in the middle, so that the moon passes into our planet’s shadow. This alignment of bodies in space is called syzygy.</p>

    <p>When the moon is within the darkest part of Earth’s shadow, called the umbra, it takes on a dramatic reddish hue, which has led to the nickname “blood moon” for a lunar eclipse, according to NASA. That shadow isn’t perfect, so faint sunbeams sneak around the shadow’s edges on all sides in the colors of a sunset, bathing the moon in brilliant, warm hues.</p>

    <h1>What to expect during the eclipse</h1>

    <p>Unlike how the sun seems to disappear during the “totality” phase of a total solar eclipse, the moon will still be visible during the total lunar eclipse because sunlight passing through Earth’s atmosphere will reach the moon’s surface. This dim lighting will cause the moon to appear orange or red — and the more clouds or dust in our atmosphere, the redder the moon will appear, according to NASA.</p>

    <p>While totality typically only lasts for a few minutes with a total solar eclipse, the moon during this week’s event will spend just over an hour in Earth’s shadow. But that’s not the start of the show. Like all eclipses, there are different phases to monitor during a lunar eclipse as it takes the moon about six hours to slowly make its way through Earth’s shadow and emerge on the other side.</p>
